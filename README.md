You can fight off words in outer-space with nothing but your keyboard :)

Also it's got a random star-field-generator so that's pretty cool.

## Usage

-   Clone the repo
-   `$ stack install`
-   `$ void-space-exe` (from the root of the repo)
-   Customize `word-list.txt` or add your own space-ships and art!
