# VOIDSPACE

Yo dawg; I heard you like types, so I made a typing tutor where you can type your types!

Fight off scary category-theory in outer-space with nothing but your trusty keyboard :)

## Usage

-   Clone the repo
-   `$ stack install`
-   `$ void-space-exe` (from the root of the repo)
-   Customize `word-list.txt` or add your own space-ships and art in `./art`!
-   Customize values in `src/Config.hs` to tweak difficulty!
